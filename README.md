### Hi there 👋

I am a codie that loves to work on the forefront of intersections between 𝖣𝖠𝖳𝖠 𝖲𝖢𝖨𝖤𝖭𝖢𝖤 and 𝚂𝙾𝙵𝚃𝚆𝙰𝚁𝙴 𝙴𝙽𝙶𝙸𝙽𝙴𝙴𝚁𝙸𝙽𝙶 ~ 
On my free time, I enjoy creating data workflows to help gain insight into real world problems. 

At the moment conjuring up Data Science Tools at <i>Synthesis<i/>

🌱 I’m currently learning: Languages indiscriminately - Spanish and C++

⚡ Fun fact: 🤷 I make good bread
